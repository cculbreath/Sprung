The maskless system allows us to fabricate arbitrary surface patterns over a 2 mm × 2 mm area with a resolution of 2.2 μm. A confocal autofocus system ensures accurate and repeatable focus. Microscopic orientational surface patterns have been demonstrated to exhibit a variety of novel functionalities, such as surface alignment multi-stability.",
