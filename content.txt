As I discuss below, my decision to apply at Apple holds particular personal significance for me. Beyond that, I am confident that my multi-disciplinary experience, coupled with my passion and expertise in photography, optics, color, and image processing, make me an ideal candidate for this position.\n\nAs a seasoned physicist with a background in optics, liquid crystal theory and devices, and hands-on experience with prototype development and fabrication, I am well-versed in bridging the gap between theoretical models and real-life application. In my current role as Senior Lecturer in Physics at California Polytechnic University, I have taught a diverse mixture of students in many areas of physics, including wave and physics optics, embedding real-world applications to ensure practical understanding. This has honed my ability to distill complex concepts into understandable content, skills I believe to be essential to the process of creating user-focused technology.\n\nThe Image Quality Engineer opening is exactly the type of position that I have been looking for, as it lies at the intersection of creative pursuit and technology. Throughout my career, I have sought to maintain a connection to visual and creative work, having started a successful photography business and instilling my teaching with well-designed, visually rich presentations and documents. At the same time, my technical credentials are well established. During my tenure as a Materials Science and Automation Engineer at NRD LLC, I initiated process improvements for auto-injector prototypes, overcoming obstacles impeding market readiness and resulting in increased efficiency and productivity. My hands-on experience in product development and prototyping has enabled me to develop practical solutions to multifaceted problems. Moreover, my superior programming skills aided me in designing simulations for various physical systems successfully.\n\nWell-versed in multiple programming languages such as Mathematica, LabVIEW, C\/C++, Python, among others, and with expert-level knowledge of software including Solidworks, Onshape, SolidCAM, HSM Works, Fusion 360, and Adobe Creative Suite, I have developed these skills through years of technical roles in educational institutions and tech companies alike. I strive to not only solve immediate problems but also maintain awareness of the bigger picture, maintaining an inquisitive spirit and creative problem-solving approach that leads to future advancements.\n\nMy Ph.D. in Chemical Physics from Kent State University’s Liquid Crystal Institute uniquely positions me for success in the tech industry. Colleagues who continue to find success in their careers, which they began at Apple post-graduation, exemplify the productive influence of our program.\n\nDiscussing the impact Apple has had on my life poses an interesting challenge. Apple’s meteoric rise to global prominence has, paradoxically, trivialized aspects of its history and defining ethos. What was once a singularly exciting–even profound–discovery made by the few of us willing to ‘think different’ has since been watered down into a collection of oft-quoted and easily-dismissed clichés. With countless high school essays invoking the words of Steve Jobs for everything from the abolition of all homework to the post-modern feminist leanings of Atticus Finch, I find it difficult to cite the same words as having a profound effect in shaping my personal identity today. Nevertheless, I intend to try.\n\nThe first major purchase I made as an adult was a Titanium Powerbook G4 back in 2002. I loved that computer. I remember spending time just looking at it, admiring it. It spoke to me. It was as if the designer of this beautiful tool was thinking about me, and cared for me, my enjoyment, my love of its use each day. It was a profound realization: I didn’t know anything could be constructed with such care, such an awareness and love for its user. Its design, both software and hardware, felt like a conscientious gift. It was my first experience with anything insanely great. This experience changed me: I learned not only how to make things in the machine shop, but to be a craftsman. I learned not only how to take photographs, but to be an artist. I learned not only how to teach physics, but to be an inspiration. I even got an Apple logo tattoo.\n\nA decade later, I discovered that Steve did, in fact, have me in mind when crafting that lovely machine. Steve said: “There’s lots of ways to be as a person, and some people express their deep appreciation in different ways. But one of the ways that I believe people express their appreciation to the rest of humanity is to make something wonderful and put it out there. And you never meet the people, you never shake their hands, you never hear their story or tell yours. But somehow in the act of making something with a great deal of care and love, something’s transmitted there. And it’s a way of expressing to the rest of our species, our deep appreciation.” Something is transmitted indeed. This philosophy has been at the core of my work ethic along with the care and attention to detail that centers all that I do.\n\nA significant lesson imparted to me by the 2020 pandemic has been a greater appreciation of certainty amidst ever-present ambiguity. Rarely does one approach major decisions in these uncertain times having quieted all doubts. Yet, I apply for this position with the rare gift of profound certainty: I know that the next chapter in my career is best spent at Apple. When given the opportunity, I’m confident that I will flourish at Apple, undoubtedly to our lasting mutual benefit.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nBest Regards,\nChristopher Culbreath\n1.\tA more savvy 18-year-old might have bought Apple stock instead.\n\nData Science Team:\nEnclosed you will find my application materials for your current Data Scientist opening—a position for which I eagerly apply. Given that my enclosed materials and online résumé comprehensively document my experience and accomplishments, I’d prefer to omit the perfunctory recitation of qualifications that typically constitutes a cover letter and instead address what appears to be a significant change in the direction of my career.\n\nI became a physicist to learn how to think. I became a physicist to solve hard, complex problems. I fell in love with physics because of its breadth: more than projectiles in motion, physics explains the big things like the cosmos, light, and the origins of matter, while also answering so many everyday questions like how a computer works or how to live efficiently.\n\nSince obtaining my Ph.D. three years ago, I have found success as an academic. I landed the job I wanted, at the university in my hometown. My academic career has a clear upward trajectory and brings the promise of success.\n\nBut, I did not become a physicist motivated by dreams of being a college professor. Nor did I choose physics because of a hunger for scientific discovery. As my résumé documents, I have a broad array of interests and accomplishments beyond the field of my degree. I sought my Ph.D. not to hone a singular focus, but as a broad credential of my grit, ambition, and capability to tackle one of humankind’s most challenging subjects. Armed with this credential, my aim has always been to bring my skills and talents to areas that I have long held passion for: people and technology.\n\nThis Data Scientist position is exactly the opportunity I have been looking for. As an experimental scientist, I have a wealth of experience analyzing datasets, developing models, and identifying trends. In my web development and computational work, I have cultivated an advanced proficiency with SQL and Python and have honed my skills and ambition for quickly learning new platforms, programming languages, and technologies on my own. In all of my pursuits, I have demonstrated just the curiosity for data, analytical mindset, aptitude for numbers, and verbal and visual presentation skills that you seek in this position.\n\nGiven my interest in software and desire to work in a team-oriented, collaborative environment, I see MINDBODY as the perfect place to bring my skills as a physicist to the challenges of the private sector. In academia and beyond, I have established a reputation as a clear, inspirational communicator, valued colleague, and trusted leader.

I relish unfolding the story of physics and highlighting the ingenuity and elegance of its theories. I am eager to share these foundational ideas (and my passion for them) with students. I find true satisfaction in writing the perfect sentence or explaining a concept with just the right insight to bring about understanding.\n\nI bring with me not only enthusiasm for the task, but the qualifications and skills required to excel as a physics lecturer. I have sought every teaching opportunity available to me during my time in grad school. I requested a job as a recitation instructor in the physics department. Over those two semesters, my students provided overwhelmingly positive reviews. Twice, I taught the summer candidacy exam preparation course for fellow graduate students. I’ve taught as a substitute instructor for faculty members, and I’ve developed and taught outreach curriculum aimed at introducing high school students to liquid crystals. Instructors and peers have routinely praised my presentations for their organization, visual appeal, clarity, and enthusiasm.\n\nI have always been a careful observer of my teachers. Despite differences in style or talent among instructors, I have found that an approach grounded in both strong preparation and clarity is at the center of every successful course. Through these observations, my own experience, and discussions with colleagues, I have carefully considered and continue to develop my own instructional philosophy to provide an effective and inclusive learning environment.\n\nI love teaching. It defines so many aspects of my life, perhaps no more so than at home, where, together with my wife, we teach the lessons of life: love, happiness, kindness, and personal responsibility to our three young children. The rewards of learning and discovery delight us all.\n\nAs a Cal Poly alumnus and California native, I love the CSU system and the beauty, people, and culture of California. I am not looking for a stop-gap job out of graduate school. I am instead looking for an opportunity to hone the craft that I hope to practice for the rest of my life. I don’t want to be good at teaching physics; I want to be great at it. My long-term career goal is to be a researching, teaching, tenured physics professor. For these reasons, I can imagine no job better suited to my skills, talents, and aspirations than employment as a physics lecturer.\n\nThank you for taking the time to review my application. I think that you’ll find that I am an ideal candidate, and I look forward to speaking to you soon.\n\nBest Regards,\nChristopher Culbreath\n\nDear Hiring Committee:\nTwo short days after graduating from high school, nearly twelve years ago, I stood in front of two hundred of my friends and family and I married my high school sweetheart. We had been dating for three years. We were in love. We were best friends. We were sure we had something special and we seized the opportunity as soon as it appeared. It was not the typical choice, but it was an easy choice. It has been one of the best decisions of my life. We were not impetuous or rash, but confident and resolved. This type of certainty is a gift. It is with this same sense of certainty that I submit this application to Cal Poly Physics.\n\nI love Cal Poly. I already know that Learn by Doing is more than lip service to a tagline. I already know that the physics faculty are skilled instructors and student-oriented.

Armed with my Cal Poly degree, I have found myself to be well-prepared for graduate school and research. In some areas, I have not only been adequately prepared, but I have had an advantage. The Q-Lab sequence offers broad exposure to a variety of experimental techniques, and the emphasis on proper error analysis is better than what others get. The two-class electronics sequence may seem like a maze of discrete circuits, transistors, and TTL logic. But these are the tools of the experimentalist’s trade, and I have often put them to use as a researcher. This is a curriculum that I am eager to embrace, even as it continues to evolve.\n\nThe enclosed application materials have been thoughtfully prepared with this in mind. I have done my best to not tell you what I expect you want to hear, but instead, I’ve explained what I actually plan to do. I’ve prepared a plan to do the best job that I can, and I count on your input on how it can be improved.\n\nI have been lucky enough to call the Central Coast home for all of my life. I am a third-generation Central Coast resident and my children are a fourth. My history and future lie in this gift of a community sitting by the sea. Without exaggeration, working as a Cal Poly professor is my idea of the perfect career.
