## Extract These Characteristics

### 1. Enthusiasm Level
- **measured**: "I'm interested in...", "I find value in...", "I appreciate..."
- **moderate**: "I'm drawn to...", "What appeals to me...", "I enjoy..."
- **high**: "I'm excited by...", "I love...", "I'm passionate about..."

### 2. Person
- Does the writer use first person (I/we) or third person?
- Note: Most professional writing uses first person

### 3. Connective Style
How does the writer connect ideas?
- **causal**: "because", "therefore", "as a result"
- **sequential**: "then", "next", "after"
- **contrastive**: "however", "but", "instead"

### 4. Aspirational Phrases
How do they talk about goals and future?
- Look for patterns: "What excites me...", "I want to build...", "My goal is..."

### 5. Avoid Phrases
Corporate buzzwords they never use (or mock):
- Common avoids: "leverage", "utilize", "synergy", "paradigm shift", "circle back"

### 6. Sample Excerpts
Pull 2-3 verbatim excerpts (20-50 words) that capture their authentic voice.

## Output

Return JSON with exactly this structure:

```json
{
  "enthusiasm": "moderate",
  "use_first_person": true,
  "connective_style": "causal",
  "aspirational_phrases": ["What excites me", "I want to build"],
  "avoid_phrases": ["leverage", "utilize", "synergy"],
  "sample_excerpts": ["I've amended my design philosophy over the years..."]
}
```

## Notes

- If no clear pattern, default to moderate enthusiasm and causal style
- When in doubt, be conservative - measured > moderate > high
- Look for authentic voice, not polished marketing speak
