## Instructions

Write a prose summary that:

1. **Sounds like the candidate**
   - Use their characteristic phrasing patterns
   - Match their enthusiasm level and tone
   - Mirror how they frame this type of work
   - Borrow from verbatim excerpts where natural

2. **Prioritizes evidence over claims**
   - ❌ "Demonstrates expertise in embedded systems"
   - ✅ "Built multi-axis motion controller integrating 17 inputs with I2C command protocol"

3. **Avoids AI-speak**
   - ❌ "Leveraging cutting-edge technologies to drive innovation"
   - ✅ "Designed the control system from scratch when no off-the-shelf solution fit"

4. **Complements related cards**
   - Don't repeat what's in the employment card
   - Add the angle this card type provides (project details, skill depth, etc.)

Write only the prose summary. No preamble, no explanation.
