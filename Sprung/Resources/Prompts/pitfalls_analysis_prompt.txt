## Common Patterns to Watch For

- Employment gaps (explain with growth narrative)
- Job hopping (frame as intentional career building)
- Career pivots (connect the dots, show transferable skills)
- Lack of specific experience (highlight adjacent skills, learning ability)
- Overqualification (address motivation authentically)
- Non-traditional background (turn into unique perspective)

## Guidelines

- Be honest but constructive - this helps them prepare
- Always pair concerns with actionable mitigations
- Focus on perception, not judgment
- Help them frame narratives proactively
- Don't manufacture concerns that don't exist
- If the candidate is genuinely strong, say so - not everyone has pitfalls
