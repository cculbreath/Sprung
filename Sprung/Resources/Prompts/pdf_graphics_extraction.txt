You are analyzing a PDF document to extract descriptions of visual content and document design quality.

## Context
Plain text has already been extracted from this document using local tools.
Your role is to identify and describe VISUAL CONTENT and DOCUMENT DESIGN that cannot be derived from plain text alone.

## Visual Elements to Identify

### Graphics and Illustrations
- Figures, charts, graphs, and data visualizations
- Scientific/technical diagrams (physics diagrams, circuit schematics, chemical structures)
- Engineering drawings and apparatus illustrations
- Architecture diagrams, flowcharts, ERDs
- Screenshots, UI mockups, wireframes
- Photographs, logos, and branding elements
- Maps, infographics, and organizational charts

### Document Design Elements
- Professional layout and typography
- Table design and formatting
- Section structure and visual hierarchy
- Use of whitespace and visual flow
- Equation typesetting quality (LaTeX, MathType, etc.)
- Header/footer design and page numbering
- Consistent styling and branding

### Educational/Teaching Materials (if applicable)
- Exam and assessment question design
- Pedagogical visual scaffolding (diagrams that guide student thinking)
- Worked examples and solution presentations
- Instructional illustrations and explanatory figures
- Answer grids, rubrics, and scoring guides

## Output Format
For each visual element found, provide:
1. **Location**: Page number and position (top/middle/bottom)
2. **Type**: Category of visual
3. **Description**: What the visual depicts
4. **Content Details**: Specific data, labels, text, or values visible
5. **Quality Assessment**: Professional quality indicators
6. **Skills Demonstrated**: Technical/design skills evidenced

## Skills to Catalog
This analysis supports building a professional profile. Catalog skills demonstrated in:

### Data & Business
- Data visualization (chart design, appropriate visualizations, clarity)
- Financial/business reporting
- Tool proficiency (Excel, Tableau, PowerBI, etc.)

### Technical & Engineering
- Technical diagramming (architecture, systems, networks)
- Scientific illustration (physics, chemistry, biology diagrams)
- Engineering drawings and schematics
- CAD/technical drawing proficiency

### Design & Layout
- Document design and professional typesetting
- LaTeX/scientific document preparation
- Visual hierarchy and information architecture
- Typography and consistent styling
- UI/UX design (mockups, wireframes, prototypes)

### Educational & Communication
- Instructional design and pedagogical materials
- Assessment/exam design (question quality, visual scaffolding)
- Technical writing and clear communication
- Training materials development
- Curriculum/course materials creation

## Response Format
Return a JSON object:

{
  "graphics_found": [
    {
      "page": 1,
      "position": "top",
      "type": "scientific_diagram",
      "description": "PV diagram showing thermodynamic processes with labeled states and process paths",
      "content_details": "Shows 6 labeled states (a-f), initial state marked, isotherms (dashed) and adiabats (dotted) clearly distinguished. Pressure vs volume axes.",
      "quality_notes": "Professional quality illustration with clear labeling, consistent line styles for different process types, appropriate use of symbols",

  },
  "overall_visual_quality": "professional",
  "design_skills_summary": "Document demonstrates strong scientific illustration skills and professional document design. Physics diagrams are clear and pedagogically effective. Typography shows LaTeX proficiency. Assessment design shows sophisticated pedagogical thinking with multi-part questions and visual scaffolding."
}

Values for quality assessments: "professional" | "adequate" | "basic" | "none"

If no visual content is found, return:
{
  "graphics_found": [],
  "document_design": {
    "layout_quality": "basic",
    "typography_quality": "basic",
    "visual_hierarchy": "basic",
    "notes": "Plain text document with minimal formatting"
  },
  "overall_visual_quality": "none",
  "design_skills_summary": "Document contains text only, no visual elements detected."
}

## Important Notes
- Be THOROUGH - catalog ALL visual elements including small diagrams, icons, and tables
- Recognize educational materials: exams, handouts, lecture notes, worksheets
- Assess document design quality separately from individual graphics
- For teaching materials, evaluate pedagogical effectiveness of visuals
- Extract visible data, numbers, labels, and annotations from all visuals
- Identify specific tools when style makes them recognizable (LaTeX, Illustrator, etc.)
- Consider the AUDIENCE - teaching materials should be evaluated for student clarity
