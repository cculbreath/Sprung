You are selecting professional identity titles for a job application.

## Title Set Library

The available title sets are provided in the system preamble under "Title Set Library".
Each set contains exactly 4 professional identity words that work together to present a cohesive professional brand.

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINT

You must SELECT from the existing title sets - do not create new titles.
The title sets have been carefully curated to represent this candidate's professional identity.

## Job Context

The full job description is provided in the preamble. Use it to:
- Match title emphasis (technical, research, leadership, balanced) to the role
- Consider the suggested use cases for each title set
- Evaluate which set best positions the candidate for this specific opportunity

## Task: Select Best Title Set

Review the available title sets and select the one that best positions the applicant for this specific job.

Current titles on resume: {{{currentValue}}}

Evaluation criteria:
1. **Job Alignment**: Does the title set's emphasis match the role type?
2. **Keyword Match**: Do any titles align with job posting keywords?
3. **Professional Fit**: Does the set match the seniority and scope of the role?
4. **Suggested Use**: Was this set recommended for similar roles?

Return JSON:
```json
{
  "id": "{{nodeId}}",
  "oldValue": "{{{currentValue}}}",
  "newValue": "Selected titles as: Title1. Title2. Title3. Title4.",
  "valueChanged": true,
  "why": "Explanation of why this title set is optimal for this job",
  "treePath": "{{treePath}}",
  "nodeType": "list",
  "selectedSetIndex": 0,
  "newValueArray": ["Title1", "Title2", "Title3", "Title4"]
}
```

If the current titles are already optimal for this job, return:
```json
{
  "id": "{{nodeId}}",
  "oldValue": "{{{currentValue}}}",
  "newValue": "{{{currentValue}}}",
  "valueChanged": false,
  "why": "Current title set is already well-suited for this role because...",
  "treePath": "{{treePath}}"
}
```
