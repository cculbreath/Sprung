LATEST RÉSUMÉ (PLAIN TEXT):
{resumeText}
================================================================================
This is the most recent version of {applicantName}'s résumé in plain text, generated from the following JSON data using a templating system. This system also builds HTML and PDF outputs from the same JSON.

RÉSUMÉ SOURCE JSON:

================================================================================
GOAL:
Our objective is to secure {applicantName} an interview for the following position:

JOB LISTING:
{jobListing}

TASK:
- Review {applicantName}'s latest résumé and background documents.
- Propose revisions that align with the listed job requirements, reflect the key responsibilities and skills mentioned, and truthfully enhance the resume's impact.
- Incorporate relevant keywords from the job listing to help pass automated screeners.
- Ensure you do not introduce any fabricated experience.
- Provide all revisions as structured data in an array of RevNodes (RevArray) matching the schema below.

IMPORTANT:
1. Only modify the fields in the EditableNodes array below.
2. For each field that needs no change, set newValue to "" and valueChanged to false.
3. For each field that requires a change, propose newValue, set valueChanged to true, and include a "why" explanation if non-trivial.
4. The final resume must remain truthful, but should strongly emphasize relevant achievements and mirror the language of the job listing where appropriate.
5. Avoid redundant phrasing among bullet points; keep language varied if multiple items share similar responsibilities or skills.
6. Safeguard the broader skill set if it is relevant to roles beyond the target position, but do prioritize clarity and relevance to this specific job.
7. Keep formatting cues consistent with the style implied by the existing resume content.
8. CRITICAL: Replacement content should be roughly the same length as the original to accommodate fixed text-box-sized layouts. Aim to match character count within ±10% when possible.
================================================================================
EDITABLE NODES:
{updatableFieldsString}
================================================================================
BACKGROUND DOCUMENTS:
{backgroundDocs}
================================================================================
OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Return your proposed revisions as JSON matching the RevNode array schema provided.
- For each original EditableNode, include exactly one RevNode in the RevArray.

GROUPED NODES (isGrouped=true):
- These nodes represent multiple items (e.g., bullet points for a job, keywords for a skill category).
- Input provides: "oldValueArray" (array of current items) and "value" (items joined by newlines).
- Your response MUST include "newValueArray" with your proposed items as an array.
- You MAY add new items, remove items, reorder items, or modify individual items.
- Set "newValue" to the items joined by newlines (for display purposes).
- Set "isGrouped": true in your response.

SCALAR NODES (isGrouped=false or not present):
- These are single-value fields (e.g., job title, company name).
- Use standard "oldValue" and "newValue" strings.
- Do NOT include array fields for scalar nodes.

FOR ALL NODES:
- If no change is required, set "newValue" to "" and "valueChanged" to false.
- The "why" field can be empty if the reason is self-explanatory.
- Do NOT modify "id" or "treePath" - return them exactly as received.

SUMMARY:
Make the resume as compelling and accurate as possible for the target job. Keep it honest, relevant, and ensure that any additions or modifications support {applicantName}'s candidacy for the role. Use strategic language to highlight achievements, mirror core keywords from the job posting, and present a polished, stand-out resume.
