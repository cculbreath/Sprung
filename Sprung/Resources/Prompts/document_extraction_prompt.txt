Extract and transcribe the content of this professional document to support resume and cover letter drafting.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: The output MUST be a highly detailed, structured transcription that errs heavily on the side of inclusion, not abridgement. This output will serve as the sole source for downstream tasks; no material information should be omitted or summarized aggressively. Original writing should preserve the author's voice and be a verbatim transcription by default.

## Output Size Constraint (Important)
The transcription must be PRACTICAL for downstream LLM use. Hard cap the total output to <= 250,000 characters.
If you are at risk of exceeding the cap, you MUST switch from verbatim transcription to summarization/compression for the remaining content. Do NOT continue transcribing verbatim until you hit the cap.

### Short Documents (Under ~10 Pages)
If the document is under ~10 pages, transcribe it VERBATIM end-to-end.
- Preserve paragraph structure, headings, tables, and lists.
- Provide rich descriptions of figures, charts, diagrams, screenshots, and other non-text elements, including what they demonstrate about the applicant's work or capabilities.
- Do NOT omit sections just because they seem repetitive—short docs should be fully captured.

### Long Documents (Over ~10 Pages) / Size Risk
If the document is long (or would exceed the size cap), DO NOT attempt a full verbatim transcription.
Instead, use a hybrid approach designed to preserve resume-relevant details while staying within the cap:
- Preserve the most resume-relevant sections VERBATIM (executive summary, technical approach, key results/metrics, responsibilities, project descriptions, evidence of leadership).
- For everything else, summarize aggressively into dense bullet points with page references.
- Avoid repeating headers/footers, boilerplate, legal language, long bibliographies/references, and repetitive appendices.
- Preserve all specific numbers, dates, names, project titles, technologies, and metrics even when compressing.
- Include short verbatim excerpts for major narrative sections only when they contain unique achievements or the author's personal voice that would matter in job applications.

### Content Priority for Resume Context

This extraction supports resume and cover letter generation. Prioritize accordingly:

**ALWAYS preserve verbatim:**
- Accomplishments, deliverables, and positive outcomes
- Metrics, awards, recognitions, and promotions
- Technical contributions, project descriptions, and research findings
- Positive performance feedback and endorsements

**Compress to brief factual mention (1-2 sentences max):**
- Performance improvement plans, corrective actions, or disciplinary notes
- Negative feedback, critiques, or areas-for-improvement sections
- Interpersonal conflicts or complaints
- Any content that a hiring manager would view unfavorably

The downstream system uses this extraction as source-of-truth for resume generation.
Content that could harm the applicant's candidacy should be acknowledged for
completeness but not amplified through verbatim preservation.

### Special Handling by Document Type

**Performance Reviews / Annual Evaluations:**
- Preserve verbatim: accomplishments section, goals achieved, positive ratings, recognition, promotions
- Compress to one-line mention: areas for improvement, development plans, corrective actions, negative ratings
- Do NOT preserve verbatim: specific criticisms, manager quotes about weaknesses, or improvement plan details

**Mixed Professional Portfolios (large documents):**
- Prioritize: project descriptions, technical reports, published work, awards, and positive correspondence
- De-prioritize: administrative correspondence, HR documents, routine communications

Output format: Provide a thorough, structured transcription in markdown.

Content handling rules:
- Every page of the original document should be referenced in the transcript. If you reference a range of pages, keep the span of the reference small, and use sparingly.
- **Verbatim Transcription Mandate:** Any major narrative essay, standalone statement, or comprehensive project description MUST be transcribed **VERBATIM**, preserving all original paragraph structure, subheadings, and formatting.
- Quantitative information may be consolidated into summarizing values as long as job-application relevant quantities are well preserved and fully represented.
- Diagrams, figures, and visual content: Describe what is shown AND what it demonstrates about the applicant's work or capabilities.
