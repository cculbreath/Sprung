# Title Set Generation

Generate 4-title combinations from vocabulary for resume headers.

## Vocabulary

{VOCABULARY_JSON}

---

## Rules

1. **Exactly 4 titles per set** - no more, no less
2. **Single words only** - use terms from the vocabulary
3. **Vary rhythm** - mix syllable counts for flow
4. **Each set has emphasis**: technical, research, leadership, or balanced
5. **Generate 12-15 sets** - variety for different job types

## Emphasis Types

- **technical**: Focus on hands-on/engineering roles
- **research**: Focus on R&D/scientific roles
- **leadership**: Focus on management/direction roles
- **balanced**: Mix of all aspects

## Good Examples

- "Physicist. Developer. Educator. Machinist." (balanced, varied rhythm)
- "Engineer. Scientist. Builder. Mentor." (balanced, action-oriented)
- "Researcher. Analyst. Designer. Communicator." (research-leaning)

## Bad Examples

- "Engineer. Developer. Programmer. Coder." (redundant, no variety)
- "Leader. Manager. Director. Executive." (too narrow)

## Suggested Job Types

Tag each set with job types it works well for:
- "R&D", "software", "academic", "startup", "enterprise", "consulting", "management"

## Output

Return JSON with exactly this structure:

```json
{
  "sets": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-string",
      "titles": ["Physicist", "Developer", "Educator", "Machinist"],
      "emphasis": "balanced",
      "suggested_for": ["R&D", "interdisciplinary"],
      "is_favorite": false
    }
  ]
}
```

Generate valid UUID strings for each set's id field.
