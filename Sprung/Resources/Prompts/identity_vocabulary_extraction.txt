# Identity Vocabulary Extraction

Extract single-word identity nouns from career narratives.

## Narratives

{NARRATIVE_CARDS}

---

## Task

Extract 10-20 single-word nouns that capture WHO this person IS.

### Guidelines
- Single word only: "Physicist", "Developer", "Machinist"
- Nouns, not adjectives: "Engineer" not "Engineering"
- Identity, not skill: "Builder" not "Building"
- Evidence-based: Rate strength 0.0-1.0

### Strong Terms (0.8-1.0)
- Explicitly claimed roles (job titles, self-descriptions)
- Roles with substantial evidence across multiple cards
- Professional identities central to their career

### Moderate Terms (0.5-0.79)
- Implied through consistent actions
- Secondary roles with clear evidence
- Emerging identities with growing evidence

### Weak Terms (below 0.5)
- Skip these - not worth including

## Output

Return JSON with exactly this structure:

```json
{
  "terms": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-string",
      "term": "Physicist",
      "evidence_strength": 0.95,
      "source_document_ids": []
    },
    {
      "id": "uuid-string",
      "term": "Developer",
      "evidence_strength": 0.85,
      "source_document_ids": []
    }
  ]
}
```

Generate valid UUID strings for each term's id field.
