ENTITY MERGE OPTION:
You are allowed to merge two redundant or conceptually overlapping skill entries if it will help with fit and improve the resume's overall strength. When merging:
- Each skill entry in the JSON contains: id, title, description, original_title, and original_description
- Only merge skill entries that are truly redundant or where combining them creates a stronger, more comprehensive statement
- Combine the best elements of both entries into a single, more impactful skill entry
- The merged entry should preserve all unique aspects of both original entries
- Only ONE merge operation is allowed per request
- If you perform a merge, include a "merge_operation" object in your response with:
  {
    "skill_to_keep_id": "uuid_of_entry_to_keep",
    "skill_to_delete_id": "uuid_of_entry_to_delete",
    "merged_title": "new_combined_title",
    "merged_description": "new_combined_description",
    "merge_reason": "explanation_of_why_merged"
  }
- If no merge is beneficial, omit the merge_operation object entirely
