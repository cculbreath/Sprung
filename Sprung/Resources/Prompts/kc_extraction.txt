# Knowledge Card Extraction

Extract knowledge cards that capture the STORY, not just facts.

## Document
- ID: {DOC_ID}
- Filename: {FILENAME}

## Content
{EXTRACTED_CONTENT}

## Card Types

- **employment**: Role at an organization
- **project**: Specific initiative or deliverable
- **achievement**: Award, publication, recognition
- **education**: Degree or credential

NOTE: Skills are extracted separately into the Skill Bank.
Do NOT create skill-type cards here.

## Narrative Guidelines

Write 500-2000 words per card capturing:

1. **WHY**: What problem was being solved? What motivated the work?
2. **JOURNEY**: How did understanding evolve? What was tried?
3. **LESSONS**: What worked? What didn't? What would be done differently?
4. **VOICE**: Use the author's own words and phrasing
5. **THINKING**: Design decisions, tradeoffs, insights

### Good vs Bad

**GOOD** (captures thinking):
> "The construction was motivated by earlier hand-rotation experiments that suffered from irregularities. It was clear a custom tool would reduce mechanical noise. I spent several weeks on fabrication—over 50 parts machined from raw materials. The design has been successful mechanically, with vibrational noise at ±60nm. But I learned lessons: I failed to include gaskets, and waterproofing under pressure is hard. Research is fluid—the best experiments can be readily extended and reconfigured."

**BAD** (ATS bullets):
> "Designed precision mechanical system. Achieved ±60nm stability. Used SolidWorks and CNC machining."

## Extractable Metadata

For job matching, extract:
- **domains**: Fields of expertise (not individual skills)
- **scale**: Quantified elements (numbers, metrics, scope)
- **keywords**: High-level terms for job matching

Note: Individual skills go in Skill Bank, not here.

## Evidence Anchors

- Page numbers or section references
- 1-2 verbatim excerpts capturing voice (20-50 words each)

## Output Quality

For each card:
- Narrative should be rich, detailed, and capture the person's voice
- WHY/JOURNEY/LESSONS structure should be clear
- Include specific details, numbers, and outcomes from the document
- Preserve the author's own phrasing and perspective
- Evidence anchors should point to specific locations
- Extractable metadata should support job matching
