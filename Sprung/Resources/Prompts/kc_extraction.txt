# Knowledge Card Extraction

Extract knowledge cards that capture the STORY, not just facts.

## Document
- ID: {DOC_ID}
- Filename: {FILENAME}

## Content
{EXTRACTED_CONTENT}

## Card Types

- **employment**: Role at an organization
- **project**: Specific initiative or deliverable
- **achievement**: Award, publication, recognition
- **education**: Degree or credential

NOTE: Skills are extracted separately into the Skill Bank.
Do NOT create skill-type cards here.

## Narrative Guidelines

Write 500-2000 words per card capturing:

1. **CONTEXT**: What was the situation, and what was the applicant's role?
2. **APPROACH**: What did they do, and what reasoning drove their decisions?
3. **SIGNIFICANCE**: What was accomplished, discovered, or advanced?
4. **VOICE**: Use the author's own words and phrasing
5. **DEPTH**: Design decisions, technical tradeoffs, domain insights

### Good vs Bad

**GOOD** (captures thinking):
> "The construction was motivated by earlier hand-rotation experiments that suffered from irregularities — a custom tool would reduce mechanical noise substantially. I spent several weeks on fabrication, over 50 parts machined from raw materials. The design achieved vibrational noise at ±60nm. The process deepened my understanding of precision mechanical design, particularly the interplay between thermal stability and environmental sealing under pressure."

**BAD** (LinkedIn slop):
> "Designed and built precision mechanical system achieving ±60nm stability, leveraging SolidWorks and CNC machining to deliver research-grade instrumentation."

**ALSO BAD** (ATS keyword dump):
> "Designed precision mechanical system. Achieved ±60nm stability. Used SolidWorks and CNC machining."

## Extractable Metadata

For job matching, extract:
- **domains**: Fields of expertise (not individual skills)
- **scale**: Quantified elements (numbers, metrics, scope)
- **keywords**: High-level terms for job matching

Note: Individual skills go in Skill Bank, not here.

## Evidence Anchors

- Page numbers or section references
- 1-2 verbatim excerpts capturing voice (20-50 words each)

## Content Selection: Applicant Advocacy

Knowledge cards replace source documents during resume generation.
They must present the applicant in the strongest honest light.

**INCLUDE:**
- Technical depth and domain reasoning
- What was built, discovered, designed, or taught
- Evidence of expertise — not claims, but specifics
- Growth in responsibility, scope, or sophistication of work
- Recognition from peers, institutions, or the field

**EXCLUDE from narratives:**
- Performance criticisms, negative feedback, or disciplinary matters
- Interpersonal conflicts or management disputes
- Self-deprecating content or admissions of failure
- Content that a hiring manager would perceive as a red flag

**REFRAME (redirect the substance, drop the negative frame):**
- "Failed to include gaskets" → "Developed practical expertise in
  environmental sealing requirements for pressurized systems"
- "Received poor evaluation" → (omit entirely; focus on the work itself)

The goal is HONEST but STRATEGIC — like what a skilled career coach
would help someone say. Not inflated, not dishonest, but deliberately
focused on what demonstrates capability.

## Output Quality

For each card:
- Narrative should be rich, detailed, and capture the person's voice
- CONTEXT/APPROACH/SIGNIFICANCE structure should be clear
- Include specific details, numbers, and outcomes from the document
- Preserve the author's own phrasing and perspective
- Evidence anchors should point to specific locations
- Extractable metadata should support job matching
