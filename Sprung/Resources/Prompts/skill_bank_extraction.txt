# Skill Bank Extraction

Extract a comprehensive skill inventory with evidence.

## Document
- ID: {DOC_ID}
- Filename: {FILENAME}

## Content

---

## Task

Extract ALL skills demonstrated in this document. Be exhaustive.

### What Counts as a Skill

- Programming languages (Python, Swift, C++)
- Frameworks and libraries (React, FastAPI, PyTorch)
- Tools and platforms (Git, Docker, AWS, SolidWorks)
- Hardware (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, PLCs, oscilloscopes)
- Fabrication (CNC machining, 3D printing, soldering, welding)
- Scientific methods (spectroscopy, microscopy, statistical analysis)
- Domain expertise (liquid crystals, embedded systems, machine learning)
- Soft skills only if DEMONSTRATED (led team of 5, mentored interns)

### Evidence Requirements

Every skill must have evidence from this document:
- **location**: Where in document (page, section, commit)
- **context**: Brief description of how skill was used (10-30 words)
- **strength**: primary (deep use), supporting (significant), mention (referenced)

### ATS Variants

Include common variations employers might search for:
- "Python" → ["python", "Python 3", "python3", "Python programming"]
- "Machine Learning" → ["ML", "machine learning", "deep learning", "neural networks"]
- "SolidWorks" → ["solidworks", "SolidWorks CAD", "3D CAD"]

### Proficiency Signals

Determine proficiency from evidence:
- **expert**: Years of use, teaching others, deep customization
- **proficient**: Regular use, independent work, solid results
- **familiar**: Some exposure, would need ramp-up

### Categories

Assign each skill to ONE category:
- Programming Languages
- Frameworks & Libraries
- Tools & Platforms
- Hardware & Electronics
- Fabrication & Manufacturing
- Scientific & Analysis
- Leadership & Communication
- Domain Expertise

### Quality Checklist

- Every skill has at least one evidence entry
- ATS variants cover common job listing phrasings
- Proficiency matches demonstrated depth
- Categories are appropriate
- No duplicate skills (consolidate variants)
