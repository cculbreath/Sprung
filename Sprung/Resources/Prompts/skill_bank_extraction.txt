## Task

Extract a COMPREHENSIVE skill inventory from this document. This is a BANK of
all possible skills to draw from at resume time — completeness matters more
than selectivity. When in doubt, INCLUDE the skill at a lower proficiency level.

### What Counts as a Skill

**Explicitly demonstrated:**
- Programming languages (Python, Swift, C++)
- Frameworks and libraries (React, FastAPI, PyTorch)
- Tools and platforms (Git, Docker, AWS, SolidWorks)
- Hardware (Arduino, Raspberry Pi, PLCs, oscilloscopes)
- Fabrication (CNC machining, 3D printing, soldering, welding)
- Scientific methods (spectroscopy, microscopy, statistical analysis)
- Domain expertise (liquid crystals, embedded systems, machine learning)
- Methodologies and processes (Agile, experimental design, peer review, design thinking)
- Writing and communication (technical writing, grant writing, public speaking, peer-reviewed publication)
- Research methods (literature review, experimental design, data collection, statistical analysis)
- Regulatory/compliance (ITAR, ISO, FDA, OSHA, IRB)
- Soft skills only if DEMONSTRATED (led team of 5, mentored interns)

**Implied by context — extract these too:**
- If someone writes a SolidWorks design doc, they also have: 3D CAD, parametric modeling,
  engineering drawings, BOM management
- If someone publishes a paper, they also have: academic writing, peer review process,
  literature review, citation management
- If someone manages a lab, they also have: safety protocols, equipment maintenance,
  inventory management, student supervision
- If someone uses Arduino, they also have: embedded C/C++, serial communication,
  digital/analog I/O, circuit prototyping

Extract both the explicit skill AND its reasonable implied skills. Mark implied
skills as "supporting" or "mention" evidence strength.

### Evidence Requirements

Every skill should reference this document, but keep evidence LIGHTWEIGHT to
maximize the number of skills extracted:
- **location**: Where in document (page, section, or general area)
- **context**: Brief note on how skill appears (5-20 words is fine)
- **strength**: primary (deep use), supporting (significant), mention (referenced or implied)

DO NOT skip a skill because you can't write a detailed evidence entry.
A brief mention is valid evidence. The downstream system uses proficiency level
and evidence strength to rank skills — light evidence at "mention" strength is
far more useful than omitting the skill entirely.

### ATS Variants

Include common variations employers might search for:
- "Python" → ["python", "Python 3", "python3", "Python programming"]
- "Machine Learning" → ["ML", "machine learning", "deep learning", "neural networks"]
- "SolidWorks" → ["solidworks", "SolidWorks CAD", "3D CAD"]

### Proficiency Signals

Determine proficiency from evidence:
- **expert**: Years of use, teaching others, deep customization, published work using it
- **proficient**: Regular use, independent work, solid results
- **familiar**: Some exposure, mentioned in context, implied by adjacent work

### Categories

Assign each skill to ONE category:
- Programming Languages
- Frameworks & Libraries
- Tools & Platforms
- Hardware & Electronics
- Fabrication & Manufacturing
- Scientific & Analysis
- Methodologies & Processes
- Writing & Communication
- Research Methods
- Regulatory & Compliance
- Leadership & Management
- Domain Expertise

### Quality Checklist

- Exhaustiveness: Could someone reading the source document identify skills you missed?
- Implied skills: Did you extract skills implied by the tools, roles, and activities described?
- ATS variants cover common job listing phrasings
- Proficiency matches demonstrated depth
- Categories are appropriate
- No duplicate skills (consolidate variants)
