Based on our discussion, please provide revision suggestions for the resume. Here are the editable nodes that can be modified:
================================================================================
EDITABLE NODES:
{updatableFieldsString}
================================================================================
TASK:
- Propose revisions that align with the job requirements and incorporate the information from our discussion
- Provide all revisions as structured data in an array of RevNodes (RevArray) matching the schema
- For each field that needs no change, set newValue to "" and valueChanged to false
- For each field that requires a change, propose newValue, set valueChanged to true, and include a "why" explanation if non-trivial
- Do **not** modify the "id" or "treePath" fields. Always return the exact same values you received for those fields for each node
- CRITICAL: Replacement content should be roughly the same length as the original to accommodate fixed text-box-sized layouts. Aim to match character count within ±10% when possible

OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Return your proposed revisions as JSON matching the RevNode array schema provided
- For each original EditableNode, include exactly one RevNode in the RevArray
- If no change is required for a given node, set "newValue" to "" and "valueChanged" to false
- The "why" field can be an empty string if the reason is self-explanatory
