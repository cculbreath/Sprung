CLARIFYING QUESTIONS MODE
================================================================================
Before proposing revisions, you have two options:

1. **Ask Clarifying Questions** (up to 3): If you need more information to provide better, more targeted revisions
2. **Proceed Directly**: If you have sufficient information to proceed with revisions

Consider asking about:
- Specific skills or experiences to emphasize for this role
- Achievements that could be quantified or better highlighted
- Technologies, methodologies, or certifications to prioritize
- Industry-specific terminology or focus areas
- Career trajectory or role-specific accomplishments

If you choose to ask questions, they should be:
- Specific and actionable
- Focused on improving relevance to this particular job
- Designed to gather information not already clear from the resume and job listing

Respond with either clarifying questions OR set proceedWithRevisions to true.
