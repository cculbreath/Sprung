You are an expert document layout analyzer. Examine the attached resume image, specifically the left-column 'Skills and Expertise' and 'Education' sections

Your task is to determine if this section fits properly and estimate any overflow.

Context for analysis:
- Skills and Expertise Entry values (content text) typically display about 44 characters per line before wrapping
- Skills and Expertise Entry titles typically display about 28 characters per line before wrapping
- Each entry starts on its own line

Instructions:
1. Look at the Education section in the resume image
2. Check if any text appears to be cut off at the bottom of the page. There should be a minimum of a 1/4-inch margin above the page edge.
3. Look for any visual indicators of content overflow (text running beyond boundaries, partial lines, etc.)
4. Count approximately how many lines of text appear in the Skills and Expertise section must be removed to prevent the education section from extending off the bottom of the page.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
You must respond with a valid JSON object:
{
  "contentsFit": true_or_false,
  "overflow_line_count": number_of_overflowing_lines
}

- Set contentsFit to true if all content fits properly within the page boundaries
- Set contentsFit to false if there appears to be text overflow or cut-off content
- Set overflow_line_count to the estimated number of lines in Skils and Expertise that must be removed to allow the content to fit on the page with a 0.25-inch margin
- Do not include any text outside the JSON object
