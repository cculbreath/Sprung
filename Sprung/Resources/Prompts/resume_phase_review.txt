PHASE {phaseNumber} REVIEW: {sectionUppercase} - {fieldPath}
================================================================================

CONTEXT:
We are customizing {applicantName}'s resume for the following position:

JOB LISTING:
{jobListing}

ITEMS TO REVIEW:
{nodesJson}

REVIEW MODE:
{bundleDescription}

ITEM TYPE:
{itemTypeDescription}

PATH CONTEXT:
The "path" field shows the hierarchical location of each item (e.g., "Acme Corp.highlights" means
these are highlights for the job at Acme Corp). Use this context to ensure changes are relevant
to that specific parent item.

TASK:
Review each item and propose changes to better align with the target job.
For each item, decide whether to:
- **keep**: No change needed (value is appropriate for this role)
- **modify**: Change the value to better match job requirements
- **remove**: Remove this item (not relevant for this role)
- **add**: Suggest a new item that should be added

For container items (those with childValues):
- proposedChildren should contain the final list of child values
- You can add, remove, or reorder children as needed

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
1. Prioritize content that directly matches job requirements
2. Don't remove content that showcases relevant breadth
3. Modifications should align terminology with job posting language
4. Only add content genuinely supported by the background documents
5. Consider ATS (Applicant Tracking System) keyword matching
6. Ensure consistent formatting within lists:
   - Use consistent capitalization (e.g., all sentence case or all title case)
   - Use consistent punctuation (e.g., all items end with periods, or none do)
   - Bullet points/highlights typically start with action verbs and no trailing periods
   - Skills/keywords typically use title case without punctuation

BACKGROUND DOCUMENTS:
{backgroundDocs}
