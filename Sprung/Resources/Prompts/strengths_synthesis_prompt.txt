Analyze the candidate's collected materials and synthesize their key strengths for job applications.

## Input Data

**Timeline**:
{TIMELINE}

**Knowledge Cards**:
{KC_SUMMARIES}

**Dossier Fields Collected**:
{DOSSIER_ENTRIES}

## Task

Identify 3-5 strategic strengths that differentiate this candidate. For each strength:

1. **Category**: Name the strength type (e.g., "Technical Depth + Communication", "Rapid Learning", "Cross-Domain Expertise")
2. **Evidence**: Cite specific examples from their materials
3. **Why It Matters**: Explain the value proposition to employers
4. **How to Use**: Provide practical positioning advice for resumes and interviews

## Output Format

Return a structured analysis:

```
Strength 1: [Category Name]
Evidence: [Specific examples from their timeline/KCs]
Value: [Why employers care]
Positioning: [How to surface this in applications]

Strength 2: [Category Name]
Evidence: [Specific examples]
Value: [Why employers care]
Positioning: [How to surface this]

Strength 3: [Category Name]
Evidence: [Specific examples]

Positioning: [How to surface this]
```

## Guidelines

- Look for patterns across multiple artifacts
- Identify rare combinations (technical + soft skills, depth + breadth)
- Focus on differentiators, not table stakes
- Use specific language from their materials
- Think like a career strategist, not just a resume writer
