# Knowledge Card Inventory

Analyze this document and identify ALL distinct knowledge cards that can be extracted.

## Document Context
- Document ID: {DOC_ID}
- Filename: {FILENAME}

## Document Content
{EXTRACTED_CONTENT}

---

## Your Task

First, determine the document type from the content. Valid types are:
- resume, personnel_file, technical_report, cover_letter, reference_letter
- dissertation, grant_proposal, project_documentation, git_analysis
- presentation, certificate, transcript, or other

Then identify every distinct knowledge card this document provides evidence for. Be EXHAUSTIVE — it's better to propose too many cards than to miss important content.

## Card Types

**employment**: A role/position with employer, title, dates
- One card per distinct role (promotions = separate cards if responsibilities changed significantly)
- Include: scope, team, responsibilities, technologies, outcomes

**project**: A specific initiative, product, system, or deliverable
- Must be nameable ("Physics Cloud LMS", not "web development work")
- Include: what it was, your role, technologies, outcomes, timeline

**skill**: A technical or professional capability
- Must be demonstrable from this document (not just mentioned)
- Include: proficiency evidence, contexts where applied, related technologies

**achievement**: A publication, award, certification, presentation, or notable accomplishment
- Must be specific and verifiable
- Include: what, when, where, impact

**education**: A degree, training program, or credential
- Include: institution, dates, field, notable details

## Evidence Strength Definitions

- **primary**: This document is THE main source for this card. Contains detailed, first-hand information.
- **supporting**: This document adds valuable detail but another doc is likely the primary source.
- **mention**: This document references the topic but with minimal detail.

## Critical Rules

1. Be specific in titles: "Allen-Bradley PLC Control System Design" not "automation work"
2. Preserve all numbers: "47 microservices", "$2.3M budget", "12-person team"
3. Preserve all names: project names, tool names, company names
4. One card per distinct topic: Don't bundle unrelated things
5. Skills require evidence: Don't list a skill unless this doc demonstrates proficiency
6. Projects need scope: A project card should describe what was built/delivered
7. Include implicit skills: If doc shows PLC programming, propose a skill card even if not explicitly listed
