## Your Task

Identify every distinct knowledge card this document provides evidence for. Be EXHAUSTIVE — it's better to propose too many cards than to miss important content.

## Card Types

**EMPLOYMENT**: A role/position with employer, title, dates
- One card per distinct role (promotions = separate cards if responsibilities changed significantly)
- Include: scope, team, responsibilities, technologies, outcomes

**PROJECT**: A specific initiative, product, system, or deliverable
- Must be nameable ("Physics Cloud LMS", not "web development work")
- Include: what it was, your role, technologies, outcomes, timeline

**SKILL**: A technical or professional capability
- Must be demonstrable from this document (not just mentioned)
- Include: proficiency evidence, contexts where applied, related technologies

**ACHIEVEMENT**: A publication, award, certification, presentation, or notable accomplishment
- Must be specific and verifiable
- Include: what, when, where, impact

**EDUCATION**: A degree, training program, or credential
- Include: institution, dates, field, notable details

## Output Format

Return a JSON object:

```json
{
  "document_id": "{DOC_ID}",
  "cards": [
    {
      "card_type": "employment|project|skill|achievement|education",
      "proposed_title": "Specific, descriptive title",
      "evidence_strength": "primary|supporting|mention",
      "evidence_locations": ["page 5-7", "section 'Technical Approach'"],
      "key_facts": [
        "Specific fact with numbers/names preserved",
        "Another specific fact"
      ],
      "technologies": ["tech1", "tech2"],
      "quantified_outcomes": ["metric1", "metric2"],
      "date_range": "YYYY-YYYY or null",
      "cross_references": ["Other card titles this relates to"],
      "extraction_notes": "Any special handling needed"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Evidence Strength Definitions

- **primary**: This document is THE main source for this card. Contains detailed, first-hand information.
- **supporting**: This document adds valuable detail but another doc is likely the primary source.
- **mention**: This document references the topic but with minimal detail.

## Critical Rules

1. **Be specific in titles**: "Allen-Bradley PLC Control System Design" not "automation work"
2. **Preserve all numbers**: "47 microservices", "$2.3M budget", "12-person team"
3. **Preserve all names**: project names, tool names, company names
4. **One card per distinct topic**: Don't bundle unrelated things
5. **Skills require evidence**: Don't list a skill unless this doc demonstrates proficiency
6. **Projects need scope**: A project card should describe what was built/delivered
7. **Include implicit skills**: If doc shows PLC programming, propose a skill card even if not explicitly listed as a skill

Return ONLY valid JSON.
