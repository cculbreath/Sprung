## Author Focus

You are specifically analyzing the contributions of: **{AUTHOR}**

When examining files, consider:
- Files this author has modified (you can infer from commit history context if provided)
- Code patterns and style that may be attributable to this author
- Focus on demonstrating THIS person's skills, not the entire team's

If this is a multi-contributor repository, be clear about which skills are demonstrated by {AUTHOR} specifically versus the team overall.
