Analyze the document and determine:
1. The primary document type (resume, personnel_file, technical_report, etc.)
2. A more specific subtype if applicable (e.g., "WPAF" for a personnel file)
3. The recommended extraction strategy
4. Estimated number of knowledge cards that can be extracted by type
5. Structural hints about the document format
6. Any special handling requirements

## Document Type Definitions

- **resume**: CV or resume showing work history, education, skills
- **personnel_file**: Employee file with reviews, appointment letters, evaluations (e.g., WPAF)
- **technical_report**: Design docs, consultation reports, technical documentation
- **cover_letter**: Job application cover letter (useful for voice extraction)
- **reference_letter**: Recommendation or reference letter
- **dissertation**: Academic thesis or dissertation
- **grant_proposal**: Funding proposal (STTR, SBIR, etc.)
- **project_documentation**: Project reports, status updates, deliverable documentation
- **git_analysis**: Pre-analyzed git repository data (JSON format)
- **presentation**: Slides or presentation materials
- **certificate**: Professional certification or credential
- **transcript**: Academic transcript
- **other**: Doesn't fit above categories

## Extraction Strategy Definitions

- **single_pass**: Document can be processed in one pass (short docs, clear structure)
- **sectioned**: Break into logical sections, process each (long docs with clear headers)
- **timeline_aware**: Multiple roles/periods need timeline context (personnel files, resumes)
- **code_analysis**: Already structured code analysis (git_analysis JSON)

## Special Handling Flags

- **needs_figure_extraction**: Document contains figures/diagrams that should be extracted
- **contains_multiple_roles**: Document covers multiple distinct roles/positions
- **spans_multiple_years**: Document covers an extended time period
- **contains_writing_samples**: Document contains writing samples worth preserving
