            "prompt": "Please generate a title card sequence accordingly to these directions:\n**AESTHETIC DIRECTION**\n\n**Visual Language:**\n- **Color Palette:** Restricted to pure cyan (#00FFFF), deep electric blue (#0080FF), and crisp white, with selective use of ultra-violet accents (#6B5B95)\n- **Typography:** Custom variable-width typeface with dynamic weight morphing, (think Futura meets experimental type design)\n- **Material Design:** Glass-morphism meets quantum mechanics - translucent, refractive surfaces with textured light behaviors\n- **Particle System:** Not just dots, but geometric micro-structures (tetrahedrons, icosahedrons) that catch and refract light realistically\n\n---\n\n**REFINED ANIMATION SEQUENCE**\n\n**0-1.2s: The Void Awakens**\n- Opens on pure black with a single, impossibly small point of cyan light\n- **Hero Detail:** As we zoom in, reveal the light is actually a complex crystalline structure rotating in space\n- Depth-of-field shifts create a tilt-shift effect, making the quantum scale feel tangible\n- **Audio:** Start with complete silence, then introduce a single, pure sine wave that modulates based on particle movement\n\n**1.2-3s: Architectural Assembly**\n- Particles don't just swarm - they constructthe a Borh atom structure\n- Each electron path is a **perfect mathematical spiral** (golden ratio-based) with real-time trajectories\n- **Innovation:** The nucleus isn't a sphere but a **dynamic polyhedron** that morphs between platonic solids\n- **Camera:** Use probe lens-style extreme close-ups transitioning to architectural wide shots\n- **Audio:** Layer in crystalline chimes that respond to each particle connection\n\n**3-4.5s: Kinetic Typography**\n- Text doesn't just appear - it's **made from negative space** by the electron trails\n- Letters have **variable opacity gradients** from core to edge, creating depth without traditional extrusion\n- **Fresh Take:** Text fragments briefly into constituent particles at  points before reforming, like a glitch effect but elegant\n- **Motion Design:** Each letter has subtle secondary animation - breathing, pulsing with internal light\n\n**4.5-6s: Signature Composition**\n- Final lockup uses **asymmetric balance** - atom offset to golden ratio point, text aligned to invisible grid\n- **Contemporary Touch:** Add subtle chromatic aberration only on the fastest-moving elements\n- Background isn't generic space but **procedural volumetric noise** creating organic, ever-shifting depth\n- **Final Frame:** Hold on a composition where every element has subtle micro-movements - nothing is truly static\n\n---\n\n**TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE**\n\n**Rendering Approach:**\n- **Ray-traced reflections and refractions** on all particle surfaces\n- **Volumetric rendering** for true 3D particle trails with internal scattering\n- **Motion blur** applied selectively - sharp on key moments, flowing on transitions\n- **Color grading:** Film-emulation LUT with lifted shadows and compressed highlights for that premium commercial look\n\n**Camera Techniques:**\n- **Virtual lens artifacts:** Subtle barrel distortion, chromatic aberration at frame edges\n- **Focus pulling:** Dramatic depth changes that guide the eye through the composition\n- **Movement:** Inspired by high-end automotive commercials - smooth, purposeful, with subtle handheld imperfections\n\n**Sound Design Philosophy:**\n- **Spatial audio:** Sounds positioned in 3D space matching visual elements\n- **Textural layers:** Combine synthetic and organic sounds (crystal formations, water drops pitched down, modular synthesis)\n- **Dynamic range:** Use silence as effectively as sound - create breathing room\n\n---\n\n**DISTINCTIVE DESIGN ELEMENTS**\n\n1. **Particle Intelligence:** Particles exhibit flocking behavior with individual personality - some lag, some lead, creating organic movement within precise choreography\n\n2. **Light Behavior:** Every light source casts accurate volumetric rays through the particle field, creating stunning ray effects\n\n3. **Typography Innovation:** Letters contain internal particle systems that flow like liquid metal, visible through the translucent surfaces\n\n4. **Depth Complexity:** Multiple z-depth layers with particles existing in foreground, midground, and background simultaneously\n\n5. **Color Theory:** Use complementary color temperatures - cool blues/cyans for particles, warm white for the nucleus, creating visual tension\n\n---\n\n**FINAL POLISH**\n\n- **Film grain:** Ultra-subtle 16mm film grain at 5% opacity for organic texture\n- **Vignetting:** Barely perceptible darkening at corners to focus attention centrally\n- **Aspect ratio:** Consider 2.39:1 cinemascope for maximum cinematic impact\n- **Frame rate:** Render at 60fps, deliver at 24fps for optimal motion blur and fluidity",
